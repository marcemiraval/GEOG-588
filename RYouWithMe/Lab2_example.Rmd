```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

### Load packages

```{r load_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(skimr)
library(janitor)
```

### Read data 

In this report, I explore Petfinder data. Petfinder is an online database of animals who need homes. Using the [PetFinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/#introduction) and R, I downloaded data available for the city of Los Angeles, CA by April 2023. 
```{r read_data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=FALSE}
dogs <- read_csv(here("data","dogs_LA_data.csv.csv")) # dogs looking for forever homes in LA (via Petfinder.com)

head(dogs)
```

### Tidy columns in the data

```{r tidy_columns, message=FALSE, warning=TRUE, paged.print=TRUE}
tidydogs <- dogs %>% 
  clean_names() %>% # Careful with the autopredict in the next lines, because column names might change
  rename(house_trained = attributes_house_trained,
         spayed_neutered = attributes_spayed_neutered,
         declawed = attributes_declawed,
         spatial_needs = attributes_special_needs) %>% 
  select(id, age, gender, type, species, name, breeds_primary, breeds_secondary, breeds_mixed, breeds_unknown, status, description, contact_address_address1)

names(tidydogs) # list the new column names

```
Since the column names were already in good shape, it just changed a few (.) to (_).

### Ask questions about the data

How many german shepherd dogs are looking for forever home?

```{r ask_questions, warning=FALSE}
gsd <- dogs %>% 
  filter(species == "Dog", breeds.primary == "German Shepherd Dog" | breeds.secondary == "German Shepherd Dog") %>% 
  group_by(breeds.primary, breeds.secondary, age, gender) %>% 
  count()

gsd
```

### Compute new variables in the dataset

Let's start by preparing a more readable dataset by piping and by using some data wrangling functions
```{r prepare_better_dataset, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
dogs_in_search <- dogs %>% 
  unite(d_color, colors.primary:colors.secondary:colors.tertiary, sep = " / ") %>% 
  filter(!is.na(contact.address.address1)) %>% 
  select(-contact.address.address2) %>% 
  unite(address, contact.address.address1:contact.address.city:contact.address.state, sep = " ,") %>% 
  mutate(close_distance = distance < 50) %>% # This is unnecessary but just to demonstrate the function mutate
  filter(close_distance == TRUE & type == "Dog") %>% 
  group_by(breeds.primary, age, gender, size) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  rename(count = n, breed = breeds.primary) 

summary(dogs_in_search)
```

Let's go back to the main question, how many LA's German Shepherds dogs and Shepherds are looking for a forever home?
```{r create_gsds_dataset, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
gsds <- dogs_in_search %>% 
  filter(breed == "German Shepherd Dog" | breed == "Shepherd")

gsds
```

**That's all for this week!**
